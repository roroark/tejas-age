To integrate with your dev environment
======================================

Points 1-3 are a one-time configuration.
Point 4 for everytime you want to change inputs to be simulated.


######################


1. Close your eclipse project, move your Tejas folder inside the tejas-age directory.
Note: The 'Tejas' folder is not the 'Tejas-Simulator' folder but the Tejas folder inside it.
If the folder is named anything other than 'Tejas', please rename it to 'Tejas' or change a line in Python/age_config.py


2. Copy your config file into the tejas-age diretory.
Again, if your file is named anything other than config.xml, you may rename it or change a line in Python/age_config.py


3. Change the line base=".." line in Python/age_config.py.
This should be the root directory of tejas-age with the trailing / removed eg: /home/dell/tejas-age.

4. Specify inputs.
Format for input.csv file:

Each line is of the form:
<input-name>, <executable with args>

A line like:
#<input-name>, <executable with args>
will be ignored.

<input-name> is used as graph labels.
<executable with args> may not contain commas (as of now, feel free to change this behavior in Python/age_simulate.py).


5. ./run
As simple as that

A note on good practice:
Please use git to version control your simulations.
This is better than creating infinite backups of plots.

Footnotes:

tejas-age is roughly 300 lines of Python.
< 1 hour to learn.

Follow the execution in 'run'.
Read Python/age_config.py first. This file contains common parameters used everywhere.

It is essential to read the code if you want customised plots.
Python/age_plot.py plots relative and absolute graphs. Not all may be relavant eg relative L1 hitrate.
Python/age_enplot.py is for energy plots.
